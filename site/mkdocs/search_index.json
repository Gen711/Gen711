Web Resources:\n\n\n\n\nSlack\n\n\nCanvas: I will use this site for grades, only!\n\n\nGoogle: everything you'll learn this semester has been discussed on the internet. Use it!\n\n\nhttp://SeqAnswers.com\n: The forums are really great.\n\n\nBioStars: \nhttps://www.biostars.org/t/\n\n\nSummer workshop website that has lots of good info: \nhttp://angus.readthedocs.org/en/2016\n\n\n\n\n6. Assignments and Exams\n\n\nIrregular Assignments:\n are assigned in class and/or lab, and are meant to enhance your understanding of the material. They are typically ungraded, but doing them will help to improve your grade. Examples may include extra reading, computer work, or other things.\n\n\nReading\n is assigned weekly in the form of primary literature. Each student will present a research paper to the class. This paper presentation is meant to be relatively informal, but will increase the depth of your understanding. Each presentation will be ~10 minutes, with a few minutes for questions. Schedule for this is TBD, but expect these to start before the 1st exam. \nFolder o' Papers\n\n\nExams:\n There will be 2 exams covering both lecture and lab material. Each will be worth 100 points. The dates for these will be October 7 and November 18. Makeup exams will be permitted only under extreme documented circumstances, or by prior approval (\n 1 week) from Prof. MacManes.\n\n\nFinal Project:\n The final project will consist of an oral presentation and written report (e.g., the methods section) related to an assembly project. Projects must incorporate an implementation of the computational techniques we've learned about. The final project will be worth 100 points (75 written/25 oral). Oral presentations will occur during the last 3 days of class. Written reports will be due on the last day of class. More details will be provided later in the semester.\n\n\nParticipation:\n Attendance to the lab portion of the class is critical. We have 13 lab sessions. 10 points each, maximum of 120 points may be earned. One lab may be missed without penalty. Additional missed labs may be made up with prior approval (\n 1 week) from Prof. MacManes\n\n\n7. Materials Needed\n\n\nAmazon Web services:\n For lab exercises, we will use the Amazon Computer Cloud (EC2). You will need to set up an account during the first lab, and will be given $100 to pay for the analyses you will run this semester. The EC2 interface will work properly in OSX and Linux operating systems. For those of you with Windows computers, you will need to use the OSX computers in the computer lab. Work outside the class can be accomplished after installation of a terminal emulator (MobaXterm is best).\n\n\n8. Grades\n\n\nThe grade scale is: 93-100=A; 90-92.99=A-; 87-89.99=B+; 83-86.99=B; 80-82.99=B-; 77-79.99=C+; 73-76.99=C; 70-72.99=C-; 67-69.99=D+; 63-66.99=D; 60-62.99=D-; Below 60=F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nMaximum Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExams\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Project\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaper Presentation\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipation\n\n\n120\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Points\n\n\n445\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Course Policies\n\n\nStudent conduct:\n Honesty is a core value at the University of New Hampshire.  The members of this academic community require and expect one another to conduct themselves with integrity.  The Student Rights, Rules and Responsibilities handbook (www.unh.edu/student/rights) explains UNH's expectation for academic honesty and defines those actions that constitute academic misconduct with regard to exams, homework, plagiarism, computers, etc.  The penalty for the first incident of cheating, plagiarism or other breaches of the university's academic honesty policies will be an automatic F grade for that assignment.  A second infraction will result in an F grade for the class.  The Dean's office will be notified and dismissal from the university could result.\n\n\nDisability Services for Students:\n The University of New Hampshire is committed to providing students with documented disabilities equal access to all university programs and facilities.  If you have a disability requiring accommodation, you must register with Disability Services for Students (DSS).  Contact DSS at 862-2607.  If you have received an Accommodation Letter for this course from DSS, please meet with Prof. MacManes privately to review those accommodations.\n\n\n10. How to get an A.\n\n\nReceiving an A in this shall should be really easy (I mean it!), assuming you follow these basic guidelines.\n\n\n\n\nCome to class and lab, pay attention, be interactive: Active learning far outcompetes passive, so while coming to class itself is good, interacting/asking questions will be much better.\n\n\nAsk questions when your confused. Come to office hours, or schedule a time to meet.\n\n\nDon't cram! Study a little, several times per week. You will remember more, and the exams will be less stressful.\n\n\nRead the papers and use (with caution) online resources.\n\n\n\n\n11.

For this exercise, a t1.micro will be sufficient.\n\n\nssh -i ~/Downloads/your.pem ubuntu@ec2-???-???-???-???.compute-1.amazonaws.com\n\n\n\nThe machine you are using is Linux Ubuntu: Ubuntu is an operating system you can use (I do) on your laptop or desktop. One of the nice things about this OS is the ability to update the software, easily.\u00a0 The command \nsudo apt-get update\n checks a server for updates to existing software.\n\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n\nThe upgrade command actually installs any of the required updates.\n\n\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\n\nOK, what are these commands?\u00a0 \nsudo\n is the command that tells the computer that we have admin privileges. Try running the commands without the sudo -- it will complain that you don't have admin privileges or something like that. \nCareful here, using sudo means that you can do something really bad to your own computer -- like delete everything\n, so use with caution. It's not a big worry when using AWS, as this is a virtual machine- fixing your worst mistake is as easy as just terminating the instance and restarting.\n\n\nSo now that we have updates the software, lets see how to add new software. Same basic command, but instead of the \nupdate\n or \nupgrade\n command, we're using \ninstall\n. EASY!!\n\n\nsudo apt-get -y install tmux git curl gcc make g++ python-dev unzip \\\n    default-jre\n\n\n\nAfter you run this command, try something else - try to install something else. R (a stats package - more on this wonderful software later). The package is named \nr-base-core\n. See if you can install it!! Installing software on Linux is easy (so long as there is a downloadable package - more on when no such package exists later in lab)\n\n\nBTW, did you notice the \n\\\n at the end of line 1 in the above code snippett?? That is a special character we use to break up a single line of code over 2 or more lines. You'll see me use this a lot!\n\n\nOK, lets try our hands at navigating around on the command line - it is not scary!\n\n\nImportant UNIX rules\n\n\n\n\nEverything is case sensitive. Gen711 is not the same as gen711\n\n\nSpaces in file names should be avoided\n\n\nThe unix $PATH is the collection of locations where the computer looks for executables (programs)\n\n\n\n\nFolders and Files are all you have.

It's not a big worry when using AWS, as this is a virtual machine- fixing your worst mistake is as easy as just terminating the instance and restarting.  So now that we have updates the software, lets see how to add new software. Same basic command, but instead of the  update  or  upgrade  command, we're using  install . EASY!!  sudo apt-get -y install tmux git curl gcc make g++ python-dev unzip \\\n    default-jre  After you run this command, try something else - try to install something else. R (a stats package - more on this wonderful software later). The package is named  r-base-core . See if you can install it!! Installing software on Linux is easy (so long as there is a downloadable package - more on when no such package exists later in lab)  BTW, did you notice the  \\  at the end of line 1 in the above code snippett??
