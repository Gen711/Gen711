#shortunwrapped.txt
#I created this intermediate file to confirm that the awk command was working, which it is.  unfortunately the sed command is not!
#The functionality of this file is that it will tell you how many files are created by the awk lines, therefore you should exec
#this shortunwrapped program before you can do your unwrapped program in order to determine how many temporary file lines (xa_) #that you must write into your unwrapped program

#so the following sed command is useless:
sed ':begin;$!N;/[ACTGNn-]\n[ACTGNn-]/s/\n//;tbegin;P;D' /home/lauren/Documents/NYGenomeCenter/epi_bless_norm_trinity.fasta:/Trinity_Fixed.fasta > \
/home/lauren/Documents/NYGenomeCenter/unwrapped_epi.fasta

#Filter based on score.  This is the command that works and will tell you how many files you are creating: 
awk -F "," '.3>$17{next}1' /home/lauren/Documents/NYGenomeCenter/epi.contig_score.FULL_Trinity_Fixed.fasta_contigs.csv | \
awk -F "," '{print $1}' | sed '1,1d' | split -l 9000
