## How To Get Going with AWS


1. Apply for an educational account at https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/apply/. This will give you $100 credit and other benefits.

**IMPORTANT**: When registering, you do not want the "AWS Educate Starter Account". You will need to type in your credit card, but no charged will be incurred (assuming you follow the directions).
